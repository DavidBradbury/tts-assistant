# TTS Assistant

[By David Bradbury](https://d-b.dev)

TTS Assistant is a front-end app utilizing OpenAI's TTS API. Easily input text and get audio outputs, store them locally, and manage your collection. Perfect for educators, developers, and content creators looking to integrate advanced TTS into their workflow.

## NOTE

This is a work in progress. The app is not yet functional.

Should have a working demo by the end of the weekend...?
