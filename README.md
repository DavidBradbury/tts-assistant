# TTS Assistant

[By David Bradbury](https://d-b.dev)

TTS Assistant is a front-end app utilizing OpenAI's TTS API. Easily input text and get audio outputs, store them locally, and manage your collection. Perfect for educators, developers, and content creators looking to integrate advanced TTS into their workflow.

## History

### Monday, Nov 13th, 2023

Saving, loading, and deleting is now functional. Need to make it so it distinguishes
between active files and new files. Once that's in, we can do some test requests,
store the audio, display it to the user, add an export option, then we're done!

### Sunday, Nov 12th, 2023

We're almost there! Restructured the UI to be easier to edit for new contributors. It
is almost functional, but I was sick on Saturday so I didn't get as much done as I
would have liked.

### Thursday, Nov 9th, 2023

This is a work in progress. The app is not yet functional.

Should have a working demo by the end of the weekend...?
