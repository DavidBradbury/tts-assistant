## What we are looking for

We're looking for contributions that improve the core functionality of TTS Assistant without adding unnecessary complexity. The project aims to leverage the benefits of modern frameworks with minimal overhead. This includes maintaining a simple build process, lightweight codebase, and focusing on user accessibility.

## How to Contribute

If you've never contributed to an open-source project before, here are a few steps on how to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local system.
3. Make a new branch.
4. Make your changes.
5. Commit your changes, and push them to your fork.
6. Submit a pull request.

## Styling Guide

TTS Assistant experiments with a unique approach to styling:

- We keep related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as close together as possible. For example, the `#page-main` section of the HTML file includes inline styles and event handlers like `onclick` functions.

- By grouping related code, we aim to make it easier to modify specific components without the need to jump between files or contexts.

- This approach aims to combine the modularity and maintainability benefits of component-based frameworks while avoiding additional build steps or library dependencies.

## Accessibility

Accessibility (a11y) is a core aspect of TTS Assistant. We're committed to making the web more accessible and expect all contributions to follow web accessibility guidelines.

Here are some key points:

- Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate.
- Ensure that the application can be navigated with a keyboard.
- Include proper aria-labels for screen readers.
- Test your changes with accessibility tools like Lighthouse.
